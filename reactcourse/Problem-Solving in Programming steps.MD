# Problem-Solving in Programming: Web Development and Data Science

#### Here's a summary of the key points about problem-solving in programming, focusing on web development and data science in Python:

## 1. Understand the Problem

- Read problem statement.
- Define objectives.
- List inputs.
- Identify constraints.
- Consider edge cases.
  - Extremes.
  - Invalid inputs.
  - Uncommon scenarios.

## 2. Break It Down

- Decompose into tasks.
  - Identify sub-tasks.
  - Group related tasks.
- Order tasks logically.
  - Based on dependencies.
  - Sequentially.
- Prioritize based on dependencies.
  - Critical path analysis.
  - Task interdependencies.

## 3. Write Down Your Solution

- Outline high-level steps.
  - Pseudocode.
  - Flowchart.
- Define data structures.
  - Data types.
  - Variables.
  - Data storage.
- Plan algorithms.
  - Select algorithm.
  - Define algorithm steps.
  - Optimize if necessary.

## 4. Translate Your Solution to Code

- Write code step by step.
  - Break into functions/methods.
  - Follow structure.
  - Implement logic.
- Follow coding conventions.
  - Naming.
  - Style.
  - Formatting.
- Maintain readability.
  - Use comments.
  - Organize code.

## 5. Test Your Code

- Create test cases.
  - Positive cases.
  - Negative cases.
  - Boundary conditions.
- Cover various scenarios.
  - Exception handling.
  - Stress testing.
- Execute tests.
  - Automated testing.
  - Manual testing.
  - Regression testing.
- Verify expected outcomes.
  - Compare actual results.

## 6. Debug Failed Cases

- Identify error sources.
  - Logs.
  - Stack traces.
- Use debugging tools.
  - Breakpoints.
  - Watches.
  - Profilers.
- Analyze logs.
  - Debugging messages.
  - Timing issues.

## 7. Move On to the Next Problem

- Progress to the next task.
  - Prioritize.
  - Plan.
- Test completed tasks.
  - Cross-check.
  - Re-test.
  - Validate fixes.
- Document issues.
  - Detailed bug reports.
  - Known problems.
- Note lessons learned.
  - Continuous improvement.
  - Knowledge sharing.
