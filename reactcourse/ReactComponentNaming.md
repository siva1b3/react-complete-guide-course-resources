- B. Error Handling (Error Boundaries, try-catch)
- C. Animations (CSS Animations, React Spring)
- D. User Input Validation (Validating user input on the client-side)
- E. Multi-language Support (Internationalization)
- F. Error Handling (Error Boundaries, try-catch)
- G. User Feedback (Providing feedback for actions or loading states)
- H. Dark Mode Support (Allowing users to switch between light and dark modes)
- I. Accessibility (Ensuring the application is accessible to all users)
- J. Browser Events Handling (Utilizing browser events like resize, focus, etc.)
- K. Device Orientation Handling (For mobile devices with orientation sensors)

## 11. Testing:

- A. Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
- B. Unit Testing (Testing individual components or functions)
- C. Integration Testing (Testing interactions between components or modules)
- D. Snapshot Testing (Comparing UI snapshots to detect unintended changes)
